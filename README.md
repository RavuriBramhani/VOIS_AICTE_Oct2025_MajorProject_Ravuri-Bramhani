🧠 Netflix Content Trends Analysis

🎯 Problem Statement

Netflix has become one of the most prominent global streaming platforms, offering a vast library that includes both original productions and licensed content. However, with the continuous growth of its catalog, it becomes essential to analyze how its content portfolio has evolved over time.
The specific problem to be addressed in this project is “Content Trends Analysis for Strategic Recommendations.”
The goal is to uncover how Netflix’s content distribution — including the balance between Movies and TV Shows, popular genres, and country-wise contributions — has changed over the years. This analysis helps identify key genres, audience preferences, and strategic opportunities for future content development and global expansion.

📘 Project Description

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights into content trends.
The analysis explores:

The evolution of Netflix’s catalog over time.

The ratio of Movies vs. TV Shows.

Top contributing countries in terms of content production.

Most common genres and release years.

Trends in content addition across years and categories.

The findings are visualized using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for interactive graphs, helping to derive actionable business insights.
